Introduction
------------

OSVR is an open-source framework for immersive media viewing  on iOS devices. While
immersive content is often conflated with the emerging platform that is VR, it presents
its own unique set of challenges for content producers, and this framework is designed to
demystify the technical side of the immersive content production process so producers can
focus on what matters - telling compelling stories. 

Initially, implementaiton will be focused on handheld viewing, as this will represent the
lions share of viewers. As VR hardware proliferates, VR focused viewing options will be
added. 

This initial build features content captured with the Kogeto Jo camera at 3840x720
resolution.
